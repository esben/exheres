SUMMARY="A built-package format for Python"

DESCRIPTION="
A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename and the
.whl extension. It is designed to contain all the files for a PEP 376
compatible install in a way that is very close to the on-disk format.
Many packages will be properly installed with only the Unpack step (simply
extracting the file onto sys.path), and the unpacked archive preserves enough
information to Spread (copy data and scripts to their final locations) at any
later time."
